How does one define a Covid-19 wave?

- Our approach:
  * X% increase over Y number of days

## Results - How deadly is the coronavirus

How does the case-fatality change over time

```

## Results - How deadly is the coronavirus

Spikes in case-fatality might be cause by:

  - Delay in death
  - Underreporting of new cases
  - Higher fatality due to strain on health case system
