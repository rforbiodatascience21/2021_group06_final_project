## Data
All raw data can be found in data/_raw.

Raw data consists of multiple timeseries datasets taken from John Hopkins

country and location. Furthermore it then consists of a variable for each day,
which indicates the amount of cases, deaths or recoveries.

density and age has been downloaded from gapminder.com/data and is used to augment
our timeseries data.
